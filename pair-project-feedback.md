# Feedback on Project Work
## Samantha and Nicole

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 9

Samantha and Nicole, this is a great project for this class. I think you will want to first focus on constructing the field and then put the particle into it. So, as you are planning the project for next week think about how you separate all the steps you have planned and who is going to do them. I will also be able to give you feedback if the project is a bit too ambitious.
