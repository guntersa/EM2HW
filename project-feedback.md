## Assignment 1

Samantha, this is a reasonable project for this class. I do think it's a BIG one, that you will need to decide on a specific aspect of to dig into - whether that's how solar winds are created, how they affect us, or something else. I think the Dessler article is probably a good one to start with because it covers an overview. It's also a long article, so is that's all you do for next week that is fine. I also think this article, might be an excellent resource for additional readings (https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1119/1.4938403)

Great work!
